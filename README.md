A single Bash script to create find active host.

I created it because I wanted a another way out of nmap to find active host inside my internal network, without any special requirements and dependencies. Works on Linux and OSX both.This script done 1% of similar work as nmap.

### Usage
Its very simple just download the file script file and navigate to your downloaded folder where to place your downloaded file and just run `./active_host IP`

If you didn't supply the any IP Address you may get this error or invalid argument

To execute just dispence the IP address of your internal network you wanna search for, then supply the number of hosts you wanna serach for and you are good to go.
