A single Bash script to create find active host.

I created it because I wanted a another way out of nmap to find active host inside my internal network, without any special requirements and dependencies. Works on Linux and OSX both.

### Usage
Its very simple just download the file script file and navigate to your downloaded folder where to place your downloaded file and just run `./active_host IP`

If you didnt supply the any IP Address you may get this error or invalid argument

After that just dispence the IP address of your internal network to search like this
